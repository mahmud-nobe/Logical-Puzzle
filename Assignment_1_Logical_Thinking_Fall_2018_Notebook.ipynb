In Part 2, the clues of the puzzle will be thoroughly analyzed using formal deductive logic, truth tables, and Python code. After your analysis in part 2, you will actually solve the puzzle in part 3. It’s important that you start with a puzzle that allows you to successfully complete parts 2 and 3. If you generate a puzzle that has inadequate clues to complete part 2, or is too difficult to solve in part 3, please start again with a different puzzle. Do not spend too much time solving the logic puzzle itself; focus on HOW you are applying deductive logic to solve the puzzle.\n"
